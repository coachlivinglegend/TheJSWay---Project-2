# TheJSWay---Project-2
19. Project: a social news web page
You know now enough JavaScript and DOM to go ahead and create interactive web pages for
real!
Objective
This project builds upon the social news program you created previously. This time, the objective
is to make a social news web page.
The general idea and page layout for this project are inspired by the Discover Meteor
book¹’s example application.
Functional requirements
• A link is defined by its title, its URL and its author (submitter).
• If a new link URL does not start with "http://" or "https://", "http://" is automatically
added at its beginning.
• The web page displays a list of at least three already existing links.
• A button exists for the user to submit a new link. When clicked, a form appears before the
link list to input the new link properties (author, title and URL).
• In this form, all link fields are mandatory.
• When the new link is validated by the user, it is displayed at the top of the link list,
replacing the form. A message indicates the success of the operation, then disappears after
two seconds.
Technical requirements
• You should reuse any useful code from the previous project.
• All your code should be correctly indented.
• Names should be wisely chosen and adhere to the camelCase convention.
• Code duplication should be avoided.
